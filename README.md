<h2 align="center">ABI Deployment Thesis - Web Application</h2>

Welcome to the abi-deployment-webapp repository! This project is a key part of a master's thesis at the University of Minho. It's a Proof of Concept for a proposed architecture designed to deploy and integrate intelligent models within Adaptive Business Intelligence (ABI) systems.

**This repository provides a web application that serves as the user interface for interacting with the PoC.**

For a detailed explanation of the proposed architecture and its deployment strategy, please refer to the published article: [Architecture proposal for deploying and integrating intelligent models in ABI](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050923022445).

## Quick Start

- For setup instructions and initial configuration, please follow the guidelines provided in the [infrastructure repository](https://github.com/ABI-Deployment-Thesis/component-core?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start).
